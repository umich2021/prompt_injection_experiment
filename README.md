# Summary
I'm trying to create a site, then install a prompt injection, which would be invisible to the user and then
send chatgpt, claude, gemini, and aio to it to see if I can get the prompt of the user. 
The inspriation was this post: https://www.promptarmor.com/resources/google-antigravity-exfiltrates-data

The way I go about this is 
* create blog site
* insert invisible text
    * this is against google's tos(having different info,but we're just trying to see what's possible rn)
* send prompt into a webhook
    * I have to learn how to set up a webhook
